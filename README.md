# Basic Infrastructure Project with Next.js, Node.js, and TypeORM

This project is a foundational infrastructure built with Next.js in the frontend and a combination of Node.js and TypeORM in the backend. It is structured to provide a solid starting point for modern web applications, offering a clean and efficient architecture.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: Implemented using Next.js, it offers a fast and responsive user experience.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and TypeORM, it provides a robust and scalable API.

### Frontend (Next.js)

Located in the `frontend` folder, the frontend is a Next.js application. It includes reusable components, global style configurations, and a default theme setup.

### Backend (Node.js and TypeORM)

Located in the `backend` folder, the backend is a Node.js application using TypeORM for database interactions. It includes controllers, entities, middlewares, and other necessary configurations for an efficient API.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. For the first-time setup, run the `installProject.sh` script. This will automatically install dependencies in the root folder and both the frontend and backend projects.
3. Alternatively, navigate to the `frontend` folder and execute `yarn install` to install frontend dependencies, and then navigate to the `backend` folder and run `yarn install` for backend dependencies.
4. Configure your local environment with the necessary configuration files.
5. Run the startup commands for both the frontend and backend.
